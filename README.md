# Assignment 1: Securing and Monitoring an Authenticated Flask App

## ‚úÖ Overview

This project combines two previous labs:
- **Lab 1**: Flask app with SSO login via Auth0
- **Lab 2**: Flask app with logging, Azure deployment, KQL detection & alerting

In this assignment, we integrate both functionalities into a production-ready Flask app that supports:
- Auth0-based user authentication
- Logging of login and protected route access
- Detection of excessive access via KQL
- Azure alerts for suspicious activity
